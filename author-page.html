            Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on
            680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data
            collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and
            diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background
            noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in
            multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into
            English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as
            a foundation for building useful applications and for further
            research on robust speech processing.

            We've trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a
            conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for
            ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge
            incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. <br />
            We've trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a
            conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for
            ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge
            incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.
            <br /><br /><br />
            Methods: We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from
            Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as
            <a href="https://openai.com/research/instruction-following"
              >InstructGPT</a
            >, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We
            trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI
            trainers provided conversations in which they played both sidesâ€”the
            user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to
            model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We
            mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which
            we transformed into a dialogue format. <br />
            To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to
            collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model
            responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took
            conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly
            selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative
            completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward
            models, we can fine-tune the model using
            <a href="https://openai.com/research/openai-baselines-ppo"
              >Proximal Policy Optimization</a
            >. We performed several iterations of this process.
