            Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on
            680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data
            collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and
            diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background
            noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in
            multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into
            English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as
            a foundation for building useful applications and for further
            research on robust speech processing.

            Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone.
            According to a July report from MacRumors, code in the fourth iOS 17
            developer beta hints at functionality for an Action button on the
            next-gen iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. Apple introduced the
            Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on
            the side of the Apple Watch Ultra that allows you to run a
            preselected function or program when you press it without unlocking
            your device or navigating to an app. Some of the preselected
            functions include starting a stopwatch, beginning a workout and
            turning on your flashlight.
